# Identifying-Creditworthiness
Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. I used various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Although the original data had an imbalance of information between good credit worthy loans vs the small amount of high-risk loans, the models' predictive capablities still scored quite high in the 80%  using the logistical regression model original data and even the oversize resampled data. Over all the model did a good job rediciting high risk loans and an excellent job predicting healthy loans with 100% accuracy.
